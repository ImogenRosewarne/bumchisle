<h1>stay inside your homes!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
<p>the rumour about bumchisles is true so we advise you all to stay inside your homes and <strong>DO NOT</strong> come out untill we have givin you a clear sign.</p>
<P><strong>We</strong> also advise you <strong>not</strong> to leave your pets out so get a litter tray ( trust me, youll need it)</P>
<p>back to home <a href="index.html"><strong>click here</strong></a></p>

<p>this is a disgrace to us all and we ask you not to panick, we are trying our best to stop the bumchisles but it will not be easy so keeping calm is the best thing you can do for us at the moment. if you have any belongings out side you may want to bring it inside because the bumchiles will steal them. if you are wondering why the bumchisles are bad well let em just tell you, they will take all your toilet paper, steal odd things ( underwear, pillows,bean bags etc.) so <strong>DO NOT</strong> go outside and attack them if we are nice to them then they <strong>MIGHT</strong> be nice back but i still would not trust them seem as they have not been nice to us in the past so all in all what i am trying to say is stay calm and do not panick and stay inside, thank you. :-) : ) assdfghhjkl;;''
